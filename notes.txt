As you can see the doubleInsert function timing is faster then the the doubleAppend function when the arrays where small, but as the arrays got bigger the doubleAppend function became significantly faster then the doubleInsert. This is because the .unshift method adds a new element to the beginning of the array as with the .push method add a new element to the end of the array. This means when you add a new element to the beginning using .unshift it will have to go through the whole array resigning every element to a new index, so the longer the array the longer time it takes to run. But when you add an element to the end of the array using .push mehtod it will only need to add a new index rather then shift all the indexes down.
